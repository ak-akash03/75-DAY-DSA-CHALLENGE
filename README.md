## üí° How to Approach the Challenge

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve (e.g., improving problem-solving skills, preparing for coding interviews, etc.).
2. **Daily Commitment**: Dedicate at least 1-2 hours every day to solving problems.
3. **Track Your Progress**: Keep a log of the problems you solve and review your solutions regularly.
4. **Focus on Understanding**: Don't just memorize solutions. Understand the problem-solving approach and learn how to optimize your solutions.
5. **Use Online Platforms**: Practice problems on LeetCode, HackerRank, and other platforms. Participate in coding contests to sharpen your skills.
6. **Review and Revise**: Every 10 days, review the topics you've learned so far. Re-solve problems to reinforce concepts.
7. **Join a Community**: Engage with others in online communities or study groups to stay motivated and share knowledge.
